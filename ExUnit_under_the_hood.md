# ExUnit under the hood

How many times a day do we type `mix test` command? How much time do we spend leaning back in our chairs and watching how lazily (they are always lazy!) our tests perform? Nowadays, covering code with tests is an important part of software development. Development without testing is like the development of a hazardous chemical compound without a gas mask and protective suit.

Have you ever wondered how ExUnit runs tests? A bit of a rhetorical question, because we always perceive ExUnit as a tool for dirty work, it should just work. Most of the time we don't even keep our code clean in tests. But anyway, curiosity killed a cat, so I decided to take a look at how it works under the hood.

## What tests are?

What do we know about tests in ExUnit? 

1. There are usually a lot of test files. Of course, you can keep all of your tests inside one file. But we are on the Light Side, right?
2. Tests can run asynchronously. There are nuances here. Sometimes async tests start interfering with each other
3. Tests can run sequentially. 
4. –¢–µ—Å—Ç –∑–∞–≤–µ—Ä—à–∞–µ—Ç—Å—è —Å –Ω–µ–∫–∏–º —Å—Ç–∞—Ç—É—Å–æ–º: —É—Å–ø–µ—à–Ω–æ, –Ω–µ —É—Å–ø–µ—à–Ω–æ. Test finishes with some status: successful or not.
5. Tests print out a report at the end of the work.
6. We have to start tests.

Doesn‚Äôt it remind you of anything? We have a certain set of scripted tasks, and we must process them as quickly as possible, each task must report on the results of its work, and as a result, a general report must be generated. Yep, this is a pool of workers. Honestly, I myself was surprised at how simple everything is arranged.

Let‚Äôs find out how ExUnit launches, runs, and finishes.

## Launch üöÄ

In 99% percent of cases, we start tests via the  mix test command, and this script looks for test files in the test directories of the project, pre launches the necessary applications, compiles the script files (a lot of important things happen at this step) and starts ExUnit itself.

ExUnit surprisingly starts with the next function:

```elixir
ExUnit.start()
```

In the project, this command is usually scripted in the *test/test_helper.exs* file.

Because ExUnit is the OTP Application it starts in the `start/1` callback as:

```elixir
{:ok, _} = Application.ensure_all_started(:ex_unit)
```

ExUnit starts the next process tree under the `ExUnit.Supervisor`:

- `ExUnit.Server` ‚Äì The GenServer module works as a test case storage for async and sync tests separately. Each test case is added to the `ExUnit.Server` using the `add_async_module/1` or `add_sync_module/1` functions during test module file compilation in the `__**after_compile__`** callback.
- `ExUnit.CaptureServer` ‚Äì Module for working with I/O devices. It is needed for tests of logging.
- `ExUnit.OnExitHandler` ‚Äì The Agent module is responsible for executing the `setup_all` and `on_exit/2` callbacks if they were added to the test case. These callbacks are always executed in a separate process outside of the test process.

Now everything is ready to work!

## Run, ExUnit, run‚Ä¶ üò£

There is a program (Beam VM) exit event handler created during the start of ExUnit. Inside this handler, the `ExUnit.Runner.run/2` function is called. And this function does all the work.

```elixir
System.at_exit(fn
        0 ->
          time = ExUnit.Server.modules_loaded(false)
          options = persist_defaults(configuration())
          %{failures: failures} = ExUnit.Runner.run(options, time)

          if failures > 0 do
            System.at_exit(fn _ -> exit({:shutdown, Keyword.fetch!(options, :exit_status)}) end)
          end

        _ ->
          :ok
      end)
```

Then I asked myself: why are the tests running inside this `System.at_exit/1` handler? What is the use of it?
It was found out it is created for the next case:

```elixir
defmodule Foo do
  # some code
end

ExUnit.start()

defmodule FooTest do
  use ExUnit.Case
  # tests
end
```

In this case, the test that is declared after the ExUnit start will be processed anyway. Thanks to Jose Valim for the clarification [https://elixirforum.com/t/why-exunit-does-the-job-in-system-at-exit-1/51641/2](https://elixirforum.com/t/why-exunit-does-the-job-in-system-at-exit-1/51641/2).

Keep in mind, this behaviour is correct when  `:ex_unit, :autorun` config is set to true, which is the default value. You can set the false value to it and run tests manually using the `ExUnit.run/0`.

The `ExUnit.Runner` module fills the ‚Äúworkers pool‚Äù up with async (if you remember this is the test with `async: true` option) test cases taken from the `ExUnit.Server`, and creates a separate process for each test case with `spawn_monitor/1`. The size of the pool is equal to the `System.schedulers_online * 2` value by default. But you can set any other value here.

When there are no more async test cases to execute, it executes sync tests sequentially inside simple `for module <- sync_modules do` cycle.

### Running of tests in the test case

One test case is one module file.

If there is `setup_all` callback declared in a module then `ExUnit.OnExitHandler` spawns a process to execute this callback and keeps the process alive till tests are complete to keep access to resources created in the callback.
Then tests list from the test case is filtered to exclude tests tagged as `:excluded.` After the tests list was shuffled.

Finally, tests in the list are executed inside `Enum.reduce_while/2`, and a separate process is created for each test.
If there are `setup` callbacks for the tests they are executed before the test run. A callback receives the `context` as an argument. These callbacks are executed inside the test process.

The test itself is called in a very simple way:

```elixir
apply(module, name, [context])
```

Where the third argument `[context]` is the context returned by `setup_all` and `setup` callbacks.

After all the tests inside the test case are complete, all the declared `on_exit/2` callbacks are called in the reserved order. Then the `:exit` signal is sent to the process where `setup_all` –∏ `on_exit/2` callbacks were called.

## Finishing the work üòÆ‚Äçüí®

Each test finishes with the one of next statuses:

1. :test_finished. The test is complete, stopping the monitoring of the test process. Completion of the test doesn‚Äôt mean that test was successful. If the test was unsuccessful then the `max_failures_reached?` check starts. If the counter of unsuccessful tests reached the number set in configs as `:ex_unit, :max_failures`, then execution of tests stops with the fail status. By default, the `:ex_unit, :max_failures` value is :infinity.
2. The test failed with some errors. In this case, failures counter increments and the `max_failures_reached?` check starts also.
3. The test execution takes longer time than as it is set in the `:ex_unit, :timeout` configs. The default value is 60 seconds. In this case, failures counter increments and the `max_failures_reached?` check starts also.

In the end, `ExUnit.Runner.run/2` returns a tuple containing statistics of finished tests.

## Printing on the screen üñ•Ô∏è

There is the `ExUnit.EventManager` in ExUnit that publishes events like: `:suite_started, :case_started, :test_started`. The `ExUnit.CLIFormatter` module listens to these events and, for example when the `:test_finished` event happens, prints out the well-known dot:

```elixir
IO.write(success(".", config))
```

The module prints out the other events in the same way.

## Summary

As you can see even with low-level process management  ExUnit has fairy simple concepts under the hood. There are many more things beyond the scope of this article. I hope this article will give you some idea of how ExUnit works.
